    <p><b class="f4">Some people move</b> for jobs, others move for love, and some just move for a change. Moving can evoke strong emotions; with each move, we move toward new chapters in our lives whether we choose to or not.
      Moving can change who we are, and how we interact with the environments around us. I believe that who we are, or develop to be, is the culmination of our experiences. The act of moving can provide clarity as to how the culmination of experiences in your life has led you to where you are.</p>

    <p>I have moved sixteen times since I was seven years old. The first move that I made was ostensibly one of the biggest, both physically and metaphorically. My mother, brother, and I moved from Hawaii to Western Pennsylvania when I was seven. This first move was precipitated by a series of events, all of which were out of my control. My mother was sick, my father was in prison, and life had just become too hard for my mother without family help. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this first move would be the catalyst for a lot of the life that I would go on to live. </p>

    <p>After we made it to Pennsylvania, we moved several more times while I was growing up. All of the moves were in the same area of Pennsylvania, but each framed distinct, vital portions of my life. During this time, I made some lifelong best friends, learned life skills, became a decent athlete, and enjoyed the typical teenage shenanigans. Each move was unique in the periods of my life that I associate with it looking back. Our first move was from my aunt and uncles’ home, and into our first family apartment. I was probably only eight or nine years old, but I vividly remember a Christmas in that apartment where my mother bought a Sega Dreamcast for my brother and me. We next moved into an old home on a defunct WYMCA camp. It was there that I learned outdoor skills, and also where I saw my mother fall into another volatile relationship—the last relationship that she was ever in, as far as I am aware.</p>

    <p>As I entered high school, we moved from that old home to a townhome. It was the best option as my mom had to escape her volatile relationship, and she did not want to move my brother and me away from our school district. I lived in this townhome through high school, and intermittently throughout college. My mother lived in the home until she died. I have mostly good memories of my time in that townhome. It is where I first became acutely self-aware. I realized that my life, while shaped by a lot of negative events, was totally within my own control. I still had a lot to learn with regard to my emotional intelligence at that point, but life, as I said, is the culmination of events.</p>

    <p>From that townhome, I moved away to college. So many things happened during my time in college that I could write a book. I had my first serious relationship, became an even better athlete, lost a close friend to death, and decided to go to law school. I look back extremely fondly on those years. I moved back and forth from home during those years, and, each time I was at home, I was able to reflect on all of the things that had happened the previous year.</p>

    <p>I moved to Cleveland to go to law school. Each year of law school, I moved to a new apartment. The first apartment that I lived in is where I met two of my best friends. The second apartment was the first apartment that I lived in alone. The third apartment was where I finished law school, and spent many late nights studying for the bar exam. The last apartment I lived in in Cleveland was in a bad neighborhood, and it was clear that my time in Ohio was ending.</p>

    <p>I moved from Cleveland to New York City for my first job as an attorney. It was the most exciting move that I had ever made, as it had always been my dream to live in New York City. The first apartment that I found was a shared apartment with strangers I met through Facebook. Anyone that has lived in New York knows the experience of living with strangers. My best friend from law school eventually moved into the same apartment, and, for a while, everything was great. It was while I was living at that apartment that I met my future wife. Eventually, my best friend and I were forced out of the apartment through the pregnancy of our roommates. Despite the pregnant couple telling both of us for eight months that they were going to move out, they bailed on that promise with one month to go. We were sent scrambling for any apartment we could find. Despite the chaotic ending of my time at that apartment, I learned the valuable lesson to never live with a couple!</p>

    <p>After weeks of searching, my best friend and I found an awesome three-bedroom apartment in East Harlem. The only problem was that we were short a roommate. My future wife suggested an old friend of hers that turned out to be a great roommate and friend. After a year and a half in that apartment, I moved in with my future wife into a one-bedroom apartment in downtown Brooklyn where we have lived for the past three years. It is at this apartment that I chose that I would propose to my wife, where I have grown in my career, and where I write this very article. However, our time here is coming to an end shortly. We are moving to a co-op that we just purchased in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.</p>

    <p>I am excited because it is the start of a new period of my life, like all of the other moves that I have made. It will be the first time that I have ever owned anything of real consequence, it will be where I will hopefully have my first child one day, and it will be where I make many new memories. This upcoming move has made me look back at each move I have made and see just how far I have come. It has also given me the clarity to see just how much further I have to go!</p>
