      <h2 class="f2-ns f3 fw2 lh-title bb pb4 sans-serif mb4">by Wild Roses Farms</h1>

      <p><b class="f4 sans-serif">When the days</b> are above freezing and the nights are below freezing, the sap begins to flow in the maple trees.</p>
      <p>The Native Americans in the northern woods of the Americas noticed that, when the tip of a branch of a maple tree was broken in the spring, sap dripped out of the tree. The sap was very slightly sweet.</p>
      <p>To gather the sap, they made downward V-shaped cuts in the bark of trees and directed the sap into a birch bark container, with a hollowed out stick.</p>
      <p>The sap was then placed in a long, hollowed-out bowl. Stones were heated in a fire and placed in the sap to bring it to a boil. As the sap evaporated, more was added, bringing the sugar content higher and higher. They didn’t stop with syrup; they continued cooking the sap/syrup into maple sugar. This was then stored in birch bark containers for use throughout the year, and was a valuable trade good with others that didn’t have maple trees. They often made thousands of pounds of it.</p>
      <p>This was the only sweetener available to them until sugar cane was brought to the Americas.</p>
      <p>The white settlers learned to make maple syrup from the Native Americans, and used the iron pots and drills they had to increase the amount of syrup that could be made.</p>
      <p class="bb pb4 mb4">If you wish, and you have a maple tree or so in your life, you can get a few taps, gather some sap, and make small batches on your stove at home.</p>


      <p><b class="f4 sans-serif">To tap the tree</b> a 5/16-inch hole is drilled about an inch deep in the trunk of a maple tree that is at least 10 inches in diameter. Large trees can have more than one tap. A small plastic tap is driven into the hole, and a bag or bucket is hung on the tap. It is important to keep snow and rain out of the sap, and it doesn’t hurt the tree. When the tap is removed, after the trees begin to bud, the hole heals up by the end of the summer.</p>

      <p>I tap about 25 trees and boil about 150 gallons of sap on my small, 16-acre wood lot. I use a 3-foot by 4-foot stainless steel flat pan sitting on a firebox made of concrete blocks. It takes 50-55 gallons of maple sap, boiled down, to make 1 gallon of maple syrup. You know it is syrup when the temperature in the sap reaches 7 degrees above boiling water (219 degrees) or a hydrometer reads 30 on the Brix scale. I make about 3 gallons a season to share with friends. A labor of love for sure.</p>

      <p>So next time you buy syrup, buy pure maple syrup. The cheap stuff is mostly or all corn syrup. Real maple syrup is expensive, but you are worth it!</p>
