    <p>I grew up on jazz and blues. My father loved Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane when he was in a smooth mood. He loved Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Taj Mahal, John L Hooker, and B.B. King when he was in a rough mood. Needless to say, I had a hard time getting into pop music at the time like N Sync or Britney Spears when I was used to these other musicians (I do enjoy N Sync more nowadays though). Thus, I liked jazz and blues and I identified myself that way. I did <i>not</i> have the typical classic rock upbringing that most people my age had: Stairway To Heaven, Take It Easy, Hey Jude, and so on. My pop was pretty particular about which rock and roll bands he liked listening to, but the Rolling Stones were one of them, probably because they were so rooted in the blues.
    </p>

    <p>I remember being about 9 years old and hearing the Stones for the first time. A song like Get Off My Cloud with this singer literally just screaming, “HEY! HEY! YOU! YOU! GET OFF OF MY CLOUD!” was something I had never heard before. The marimbas on Under My Thumb or the twinkling piano on Monkey Man entranced me. I would sneak into my pop’s CD collection to find these Stones CDs to listen again and maybe even…find some more songs. Needless to say, the Stones were the first band I ever loved, and they were my gateway into rock and roll as a whole umbrella of a genre. I did eventually run into Stairway to Heaven and Hey Jude.
    </p>

    <p>The Rolling Stones have a tricky and intimidating catalogue. They lasted longer than pretty much any other band, so they do not have a neat discography like Led Zeppelin or the Beatles, and there are a few bad albums here and there. In the early days, they would release differing versions of albums in the UK vs US; here, I am going by the US releases because they are more thorough. The band went through lineup changes with three different guitarists to accompany Keith Richards, different producers, and many different musical eras. Their catalogue is very front heavy; they used to release 2-3 albums a year and now seem to release one every 10 years. They have been getting called old since they hit their 30s back in the 1970s, so they have the spent 50 out of their 60 years as a band being called old. On top of this, their last relevant album came out in 1981, and while that was already their 19th album (NINETEEN!) they have existed longer as a non-relevant band than a relevant one and get some flack for that. But I promise you, what makes the Rolling Stones most phenomenal is the sheer vastness of their catalogue. Here are all 25 US albums, from worst to best.

    <p>This is a truly dirty work and easily the worst Stones record ever. It’s the low point of their vast career, when the songwriting team of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards was not functional. Mick was consumed with his solo career, allegedly saving his best songs for an upcoming solo album, with Keith’s grudge over this ever growing. The band had also not toured for four years, making the playing chemistry relatively stiff. On top of this, Mick and Keith had very different ideas of what a mid 80s Stones album should sound like. Keith firmly wanted to stick to their traditional gritty rock and roll sound, while Mick firmly wanted to delve into more contemporary 80s dance and synth sounds….the results are jarring. The only reason to listen to this album is to be a completist who wants to study their whole body of work. The band would break up for a few years after this and reunite in 1989 with <i>Steel Wheels</i>, a huge improvement.

    <p>The album that precedes Dirty Work. This is the beginning of the decline. Mick was just <i>beginning</i> to lose interest in the Stones and have his eye on a solo career, and Keith was just <i>beginning</i> to realize this. As with Dirty Work, Mick wanted to try newer 80s pop sounds and Keith wanted to just rock, but there are some differences that make this album slightly more listenable . Keith was more open to trying out 80s pop sounds and bringing his ass kicking style to compliment those sounds, which gives us a treasure like Undercover of the Night. The band was also fresh off the 2 year tour to support Tattoo You, so the playing is much tighter. Nonetheless, the album is very inconsistent and lacks focus. Not recommended.

    <p>This is a famous blunder of an album. With Mick and Keith being busted for drugs and dealing with a lot of court drama, as well as Brian Jones actually degrading from drugs and never showing up to anything, there were several obstacles that made this album take a long time to finish. The result is too much studio tinkering with songs that may have been better otherwise. The album sounds and looks like a near-complete ripoff of the Beatles’ psychedelic pop work on Sgt. Pepper, but so much worse. This is the Stones’ identity crisis moment, where they were trying so hard to match the Beatles that they lost what made the Stones themselves great in the first place. Luckily, they would correct course and return to their blues roots next year with <i>Beggars Banquet</i>, an album that marks the beginning of their true golden era.

    <p>This one is a mixed bag. Mick was really wanting to try some new sounds (are we noticing a theme yet?) and their producer, Don Was, decided to roll with it. On one hand, some of the very best songs of the modern Stones era are on this album, like Saint of Me and Out of Control. On the other hand, the album is highly overproduced with voice filtering, drum machines, electronic sounds, and even some rapping, making it is easy to get distracted from the actual songs. With all that said, the album is ambitious enough to stay interesting the whole time.

    <p>A bizarre cover. If this were an album by an average band, it would be considered very good. But this is the Stones, so the standard is exceptionally high and the album is one of their least impressive releases. Ironically, it had the best opening weekend (sales-wise) of all their albums, mostly because it was the highly anticipated follow up to <i>Some Girls</i>, one of their best. This album’s greatest strength is its diversity of genres, with disco, punk, reggae, and even some Mexican trumpets in there, making for a fun listen from start to finish. However, it lacks focus and has some songs that are a delight while others are a bit boring or strange.

    <p>The most recent Stones release to date, this album was long overdue. The very first Stones album was a covers album where they simply played their own versions of their favorite blues songs. Here, we have them doing that exact thing again, but with 50 extra years of experience as musicians and as human beings. The story goes that they were trying to write some new material for an album and were having a hard time, so they decided to loosen up by playing some blues. They were having so much fun that they decided to release what they played, and so we have this album. The Stones shine best when they are enjoying themselves, and it shows here. Eric Clapton even makes an appearance on two songs because he just happened to be at the same studio and bumped into them!! The album’s only flaw is it is 100% blues, so it can be a bit monotonous after 40 mins. But if this ends up being the final Stones album, it would be a perfect finish that is wonderfully cyclical.

    <p>After releasing two of their worst albums, <i>Undercover</i> and <i>Dirty Work</i>, Mick decided to leave the band and go full solo. His solo album was very poorly received, while Keith released a solo album that was pretty good. The two both went on solo tours and learned to appreciate what the other had been doing all those years; Mick realized the Stones as a band provide the best sound for him and Keith realized how hard it is to actually be a front man. After doing some soul searching, the two made up, got the band back together, and released <i>Steel Wheels</i>. Nothing is really groundbreaking on here, but it is highly refreshing to hear a good rock and roll album that is consistent, joyful, and focused the whole way through.

    <p>The follow up to <i>Steel Wheels</i>, this is the first album with producer Don Was and the first album without Bill Wyman, who retired from playing bass after the humongous <i>Steel Wheels</i> world tour. Apparently, as usual, Mick was very consumed with trying new sounds out, whereas Don Was wanted them to try to emulate their late 60s/early 70s sound that focused on blues and country with an emphasis on guitar riffs. Don Was got his way, and the result is the first album in 20 years that sounds like the traditional golden era “Stones” sound, which is a true delight. The flaw here is that it is from the CD era, so the album is about 20 mins longer than it needed to be and has some songs that should’ve been left in the studio. But the good songs are fun, the singing is great, the guitar is dirty, the drums are ass kicking, and there is good variety, The album even won a Grammy for Best Rock album.

    <p>The second Stones album ever, this album only exists in the American chronology. In the UK, these songs were releases as singles, B sides, or on EPs. As a result, the songs are sort of all over the place as far as the production quality, since different songs were recorded into different studios. But only a few months after their first album, you can already hear the Stones progressing. Their first album was pretty pure blues, while this one has more experimentation with tempos, acoustic vs electric, an instrumental song, and more songs written by the band themselves.

    <p>This is it: the one that started it all. The Stones’ debut album was pretty simple in its purpose: they played their own versions of blues songs they loved, with the hopes of spreading the blues into more of England. However, the Stones were not older, African American men jaded by a life of poor luck like their musical heroes; they were young, British, white kids who were frustrated by the world around them. They played more metallic, more recklessly angry, and energetic to the point of frantic. The musical result is rock and roll as we now think of it. Every band to follow that got into the blues and every group of teens that decided to make a garage rock band, owes much to this album. The echoes of this debut are heard everywhere.

    <p>The third installment in the Don Was era of albums, this one follows the blues/country rock focused <i>Voodoo Lounge</i> and the jarringly overproduced <i>Bridges to Babylon</i>. <i>A Bigger Bang</i> is more of a basic approach, where the band rocks out for over an hour. They sound great here, which the whole band firing on all cylinders, the melodies catchy, and no one overthinking what makes them fun to listen to in the first place. But like <i>Voodoo Lounge</i>, this album is a bit too long and could’ve been tapered down to a more concise and impressive release.

    <p>The fifth Stones album, <i>December’s Children</i> was only released in the US, which means these songs were all British singles, B sides, live cuts, or just random leftovers that were cobbled together to force an album into existence. Nonetheless, this release is very fun to listen to and reflects the band’s musical phase at the time. Half of the songs are covers of blues, soul, or even malt shop songs from the 50s, while the other half are songs they wrote themselves. And the songs they wrote are getting good!! Get Off My Cloud, I’m Free, and Gotta Get Away all hold up today as great Stones songs. It is logical that the next album would be <i>Aftermath</i>, the first album that was 100% original material.

      <p>Their third album ever released and the third album to be mostly covers. If you are going to listen to one album from the Stones’ “blues covers” era, this is the one. They pick great songs from the cannon of American blues, soul, and R and B. The band has also found their own playing style more so than on their first 2 albums, with everyone sounding more confident. The guitars are more dirty and Mick is more nasty and cynical. It is easy to hear how they would soon transition into the rock and roll band the world is more familiar with. But make no mistake; this is a good blues album in its own right.

      <p><i>Out of Our Heads</i> is a delight. It is the follow up to <i>Now!</i>  and shows the band’s growth continuing steadily. Rather than playing mostly blues songs, their attention had shifted to soul and Motown, with renditions of songs by artists like Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, and Marvin Gaye. In addition, they were writing more and more of their own songs, with this being the first album where the original songs are the highlights. Play With Fire is a wonderfully creepy song that sounds like Dracula would play it to his victims, Spider and the Fly is a blues songs that creeps along infectiously, and of course the album has the band’s first true mega hit: (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction. There would be no looking back from here.

      <p>Yes, the cover is strange. <i>Goats Head Soup</i> is a misunderstood and underrated album. At the time of its release, it was a disappointment. It came out after the run of <i>Beggars Banquet</i>, <i>Let It Bleed</i>, <i>Sticky Fingers</i>, and <i>Exile on Main Street</i>, and it sounded relatively boring and lacking melody.</p>

      <p>But if <i>Exile</i> is the sound of a debauched party, <i>Goats Head Soup</i> is the sound of a regretful hangover. This album is the sound of loneliness, disappointment, and fatigue, with more mellow songs than fast ones. It did however introduce some funk, which was a new genre for the band at the time. Mick Taylor has some searing guitar work across the board, whether on the beautiful ballad, Winter, or the funk rock of Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Keith is pretty absent here due to him starting to significantly spiral into drug addiction, but Star Star is a fantastically rude Keith-centric rocker. The album takes a few listens to appreciate, but it is a rich, textured piece and is unique in their catalogue.

      <p>Another underrated album, <i>Black and Blue</i> is from the mid 70s phase in between the golden era and <i>Some Girls</i>. It is the first album after Mick Taylor left the band, and the band decided to hold tryouts and jam with different guitarists before they finally went with Ron Wood. This album is composed of some of those jams, plus some well written ballads such as Memory Motel and Fool to Cry. Fans and critics were disappointed at the time because they were not expecting a jam album and found it to lack focus. But if you come in with an open mind, the album is very good. The jams draw from funk, reggae, and jazz, and the ballads are very 70s with an emphasis on keyboards and falsettos. It makes for a fun listen and, like <i>Goats Head Soup</i>, is an album that is unique in the catalogue.

      <p>The name says it all, right? Lodged in between the moody <i>Goats Head Soup</i> and the jammin’ <i>Black and Blue</i>, this album is a bit more straightforward and obviously rocks out. The Stones were getting tired of music critics, since their last 3 albums had been initially slandered and then eventually praised—hence the snarkiness of declaring: it’s only rock and roll, but I like it. Here, the songs are punchy, melodic, and energetic. The title is deceiving though; this album is not only rock and roll; there is Motown in Ain’t Too Proud To Bed, a nice ballad in Till the Next Goodbye, continued exploration of funk on Fingerprint File, and their first dabble into reggae with Luxury. This is Mick Taylor’s final album with the band, and his playing is exceptional on the mysterious sounding Time Waits For No One.

      <p>The year 1967 and the Stones have a bad association, mostly because they released <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>, and that was a stinker. However, in the beginning of that same year, they released <i>Between the Buttons</i>, which is a wonderfully gentle and eccentric sounding album. There are recorders, trumpets, kazoos, and lots of other quirky stuff going on here. With classics such as Ruby Tuesday and Let’s Spend the Night Together plus a slew of great deep cuts that you probably have not head before, this album is a gem. It often gets overshadowed by its predecessor, <i>Aftermath</i>, and it certainly does not sound like the conventional snarky Stones, with more in common with the Kinks and Beatles than Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. But this is the good Stones album from the psychedelic era of pop music, and it sounds like none of their other albums.

      <p>A classic album cover, a classic single, and a huge tour. You know a band is great when one of their classic albums is not in their top 5. In 1981, the Stones wanted to tour and but had no new material, so they had the idea to cobble through unfinished songs from all their 70s sessions, find the good ones, finish them up, and give them a contemporary 80s production sound. The result is a great album! Side 1 is all upbeat songs, Side 2 is all laid back songs. There is rock and roll on Little T and A, there is punk on Neighbors, there is jamming on Slave, there is blues on Black Limousine, there is a classic riff on Start Me Up, and there is sincerity on Waiting On A Friend. After this, the band started to spiral downward through the 80s and then resurface with good, but not quite great albums to follow in the late 80s through to today. This is the last undoubtedly great and culturally relevant release.

      <p>A landmark moment in the band’s career. After 5 albums of some covers and some originals, the band released their first all-originals album. The result is fantastic. The UK and US version are different in that the US version omits 4 songs from the UK version….but the US version has Paint It Black, which is absent from the UK version. Overall, the UK version is superior. Not every song is great, but the lesser songs are still very listenable. Mick and Keith were exploring the unique balance of embracing the pop sounds of Motown, the Beach Boys, and the Beatles, while infusing it with the sarcasm, cynicism, attitude, and occasional insensitivity  they had learned from their blues icons and developed for themselves. On top of this, Brian Jones lost interest in guitar and wanted to try a variety of different instruments out. There is sitar and depression on Paint It Black, double slide guitars and drug addiction in Mother’s Little Helper, marimbas and misogyny in Under My Thumb and Out of Time, bluegrass in High and Dry, and dulcimers/renaissance sounds in Lady Jane. This album is not perfect, but it is easily the best album from the Brian Jones-era of the band.

      <p>This is the album that resurrected the Stones for both fans and critics. While the mid 70s albums were good and are seen as better in retrospect, they were disappointments in their time. People saw the Stones as old (they were over 30, after all) and washed up. Punk bands had come on the scene and were trash talking the older bands. This seemed to be the spark needed to light the Stones once more. Here, Mick got to have his way and try new sounds out with great success. <i>Some Girls</i> dabbles with disco on Miss You, rap on Shattered, and punk on Lies, in addition to more usual genres such as R and B on Beast Burden, motown on Just My Imagination, blues rock on Some Girls, and country on Far Away Eyes. This album is energetic, funny, and highly consistent. The band had something to prove, and they proved it; they made a new wave era classic. It is very hard not to like this album.

      <p>The top 4 Stones albums are no secret; they came out consecutively from 1968-1972 and are arguably the best run of albums by any rock and roll band ever. This is the Rolling Stones’ golden era. Now comes the ordering of those 4 albums. Some people will scream that this album is not number 1. Alas. They can make their own list. The story goes that the band was having tax issues in England and had to take up residence elsewhere, so they moved to the south of France. The band, their families, and their friends all stayed at Keith Richards’ house for a three month long never ending party full of sex, drugs, and of course rock and roll. From the haze emerged this album, what some critics consider their finest release. It lacks the focus and direction of the other albums of this era, which is why it can never be number 1 for me. But the lack of direction is the very nature of what makes this album appealing. Yes, there are fan favorites here for sure (Tumbling Dice, All Down the Line, Rocks Off, Sweet Virginia), but there are no true radio classics. It is a double album by one of the world’s most famous bands, and it is all deep cuts. Hence, it is the forever hipster favorite. The aesthetic of this album is truly unmatched. Mick’s words are unintelligible (which is the point), the guitars are greasy and dirty, the jazzy horns are blaring, the gospel vocals are powerful, and the party is going. It is a concoction of all that the band loved and all that had made rock and roll what is was by 1972: blues, jazz, country, gospel, soul and unwavering, unapologetic energy. This album is the definition of raw, passionate and wild, and there is nothing else quite like it.

      <p><i>Beggars Banquet</i> is the album that began the Stones’ golden era. They had started as a blues cover band and transitioned into a songwriting rock and roll band that had been dabbling more and more in pop psychedelia. After the failure of <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>, they took a step back and decided to truly go back to basics. Here is an album that has nothing to do with what was going on with pop music in 1968, and it was the best album they had released yet, because it was based on their own passions, rather than the desire to be popular. This is also the first album with new producer Jimmy Miller, who produced all their golden era albums. He knew how to bring out the best in the band and what finer touches to add to the end of a song. The album opens with all time classic Sympathy for the Devil, infused with African drum sounds and excellent lyrics from the point of view of the devil himself. Following that comes a slew of songs drenched in acoustic, old style blues and plenty of country as well. With a ballad like No Expectations, a rocker like Street Fighting Man, or a closing ode like  Salt of the Earth, this album will always hold up as basic and simple—but timeless.

      <p>What a cover! The follow up to <i>Beggars Banquet</i>, this album is the sound of the apocalypse. The end of the 1960s was a turbulent time, with the Vietnam war, the civil rights movement, and assassinations galore (MLK, Bobby Kennedy). With this plus band issues with Brian Jones and his sudden demise, the band felt a sense of impending doom, and it shows on this album. The opening track is Gimme Shelter, the ultimate sound of the end of the world, with insanely good vocals by Merry Clayton (producer Jimmy Miller’s idea) that only make the fear greater when her voice unintentionally cracks while belting the word MURDER. Love in Vain is possibly the Stones’ best cover, emitting the sound of the last person on earth walking through the desert. There is debauchery on Country Honk, Live With Me, and Let It Bleed, as well as real terror in the blues epic Midnight Rambler (which would become a concert staple). And at the end of the album, while it is jaded and guarded, there is hope in You Can’t Get Always What You Want. This album is easily one of the greatest albums of the rock and roll canon.

      <p class="pb4">Ah yes, the one with the zipper. The cover was done by Andy Warhol, and it is still disputed whose crotch is actually on there (it’s not Mick). This album came following the death of Brian Jones, the murder of a fan by a Hell’s Angel member at a free Stones concert in Altamont, and with the knowledge that England would soon be kicking the Stones out of the country for tax reasons. At this point in time, the Stones felt like they could no right and the whole world was against them. The result is this album. While it may have a raunchy cover, a raunchy name, and a raunchy opening song in the interracial sexual fantasy that is Brown Sugar….this album is not a simple strutting rock and roll album. It has interspersed strutting moments, like the latin jazz jam Can’t You Hear Me Knocking and the riff-centric Bitch. But as the album progresses, the mood goes further and further downward. There is Sway, a song reflecting on the death of Brian Jones. There is Wild Horses, a genuine attempt at an aching country ballad that pulls it off. There is I Got the Blues, a depressed Otis Redding style soul ballad. There is Sister Morphine, a dark and frightening song from the point of view of a dying morphine addict. And closing the album is Moonlight Mile, a totally unique song dabbling in Japanese sounds and orchestral drama that reflects on the fatigue from constantly being on the road and away from home. <i>Sticky Fingers</i> is a masterpiece that starts as a classic Stones party and descends into a uniquely sincere reflection on the darker side of the rock and roll lifestyle.
