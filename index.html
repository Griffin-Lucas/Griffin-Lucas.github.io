      <p>I have been interested in photography for a while, but the pandemic has heightened that interest and spurred me on to take it more seriously as a hobby and a practice. It has helped get me out of the house and explore places in San Francisco I have not visited before. It takes my mind off the bleary sameness of each day.  I have even made some new friends and deepened existing relationships because of it. But my favorite thing about it is how it has subtly shifted the way I look and move through the city. The things that catch my eye, the speed at which I walk, the streets I decide to take. I even have my headphones in less often because I cannot be as open to the world around me as I need to be. It has reawakened a curiosity in me and given me a second chance at seeing things for the first time.</p>
      <p>My style is still evolving and is sometimes (frustratingly) hard for me to articulate concisely. Much of the time when I am out shooting, I am being guided by my gut rather than a clearly defined goal. It lends itself to a little mystery when I go for a walk with my camera but also leads to SD cards filled with aimless images. But what I have come to realize over the past year is that the review process after shooting is where the learning happens, the words begin to form, and where the evolution of style takes place, not when I have my camera in my hand on the street. There is something about looking at the photos with a certain level of remove that lets the underlying voice that my gut was responding to rise to the surface. The below is a small example of what my internal review looks like for a set of photos.</p>

      <p>I visited The Land of Medicine Buddha in Santa Cruz, California a few weekends ago with my partner. It is an active Buddhist community nestled in the forested foothills about 5 miles from the beach. After walking around the grounds for some time we came upon this temple. I walked up the steps and spied a car covered in this recently purchased blue tarp off to the side that I knew I needed to take photos of. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="fl w-100 w-third-ns tl pl2-ns pr2-ns">
          <p>I walked closer and took a couple of tight-cropped shots that tend to be my framing of choice.</p>
          <p>In review, they are fine but I do not like the angle and distance from the car. Plus, there are too many extraneous details - the sign in the background, the distracting shadows in the foreground and covering the back of the car, the harsh light in the background.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fl w-100 w-third-ns tc pl1-ns">
          <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0032.png?raw=true" alt="32">
        </div>
      </div>

    <p>From there I walked to ground level and around to the front of the car. I wanted to get closer to the car so I could cut out more of the surrounding scene at a more realistic angle. My lens has a fixed focal length so I needed to zoom in with my feet.</p>

    <div class="cf">
      <div class="fl w-100 w-50-ns tc pr1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0036.png?raw=true" alt="36">
      </div>
      <div class="fl w-100 w-50-ns tc pl1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0052.png?raw=true" alt="52">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>These are getting closer to feeling right, but still suffer from the same issues as the previous ones. There is too much foreground and background clutter that does not let my eye feel comfortable. However, approaching the car was definitely the right strategy for this scene.</p>
    <p>I do not generally take landscape shots as I find that I cannot isolate the scenes into their component parts enough for my taste. I took a few of this car, but they are not doing it for me.</p>

    <div class="cf">
      <div class="fl w-100 w-50-ns tc pr1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0042.png?raw=true" alt="42">
      </div>
      <div class="fl w-100 w-50-ns tc pl1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0041.png?raw=true" alt="41">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The nits with these images that immediately caught my eye were the items in the back seat and the fountain in the background. They do not add anything to the scene and cropping them out changed the ratio of blue to not-blue in a way that gave the blue too much weight. Also, the focal point in these shots is too ambiguous and bland. These are not it.</p>
    <p>I captured some photos of the other side of the car but the light is too harsh, though more adept editing skills could make them work.</p>

    <div class="cf">
      <div class="fl w-100 w-third-ns tc pr1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0044.png?raw=true" alt="44">
      </div>
      <div class="fl w-100 w-third-ns tc pl1-ns pr1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0047.png?raw=true" alt="47">
      </div>
      <div class="fl w-100 w-third-ns tc pl1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0048.png?raw=true" alt="48">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>There are interesting rust patterns, lines, dents, and dirt splatters, but the quality of light is missing for me. The far left one is the strongest but the glare of the sun is drowning out the blue of the tarp too much.</p>

    <div class="cf">
      <div class="fl w-100 w-third-ns tc pr1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0038.png?raw=true" alt="38">
      </div>
      <div class="fl w-100 w-third-ns tl pl2-ns pr2-ns">
        <p>Now we are getting to it. The colors on this side of the car, in the shade, are really popping. The blue of the tarp, the dirty gray of the paint, the red and white stripes. These are the closest yet.</p>
        <p>But, there are a few things that prevent me from saying these are the ones. In the left image, the turned wheel gives a weird tension and it draws too much of my eye’s attention. The same goes for the seat in the second image. It distracts my eye too much and it being out of focus doesn’t work for this shot.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fl w-100 w-third-ns tc pl1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0040.png?raw=true" alt="40">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Finally, here is the shot that I deemed the best. When I was reviewing these photos a couple of weeks after the fact, this image popped immediately.</p>

    <div class="cf">
      <div class="fc w-100 tc pr1-ns">
        <img class="mt2 mb2 w-50-ns w-100" src="https://github.com/Griffin-Lucas/Griffin-Lucas.github.io/blob/main/Images/DSCF0043_edited.png?raw=true" alt="43">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This photo tells you everything you need to know that it is a car while leaving some mystery to it. The wiper blade is obvious but the more you look, the more about it is revealed. There is some level of care given to the car, with the tarp haphazardly draped over it, however, it has still been put through its paces. The dusty paint, the scratches, the semi-popped hood all suggest some depth to the backstory of this car sitting in a Buddhist center in the middle of a forest on some foothills not far from the Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p>Despite the car’s well-worn state, there is beauty in the scene. The striking blue of the new tarp is deep and textured, the red and white stripes come and go quietly, and the gray paint beneath the dust hints at some life still left in it if it could only get a wash.</p>

    <br>

    <p>I am still learning what my subconscious is being drawn to when I approach a scene. These photos were not all necessarily presented in the order that they were taken. The best shot (to me) was actually taken right in the middle of my time with this car. I placed the photos in order in which I reverse-engineered the story as I reviewed them some weeks later. When I am shooting, I am more impulsive and less analytical, closer to a flow, being pulled by my eye without always knowing the exact reason.</p>
    <p>I did not realize I had the shot when I took it nor when I quickly went through my photos at the end of the day. But on a quiet Saturday afternoon, far past the day I took these photos, it was obvious which was the strongest.</p>
    <p>I am sure (I hope?) the more experienced I get, the more I will know what exactly I see in a scene when I approach it, thinning the barrier between what I pull from the photos when I look at them later and what my eye is drawing me towards in the moment, allowing me to distill my style in an explicable way. Or maybe I will have moved on, need to move on, by the time I begin to understand, chasing what I am drawn to but cannot quite explain. Either way, I will have my camera with me to capture it.</p>
