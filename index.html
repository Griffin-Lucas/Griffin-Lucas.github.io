      <h2 class="f2-ns f3 fw2 lh-title pb2 sans-serif">by JBH</h1>

      <p>One of my few highlights from the Covid era is that I’ve gotten back into drawing consistently, for the first time in years. But one of the hardest parts of that hobby for me is just deciding what to draw. So to try to squash the amount of time I might spend with my iPad & Pencil idly in hand, trying to think of an idea, I started a phone note to jot down ideas whenever I have them. As a huge nerd, my most populated categories in this note are “Team-ups”, “Duos”, and “Mashups”.
      </p>
      <p>I’m going to walk you through my process for one of my favorite drawings, a mashup of The Mandalorian, and the Pokemon Cubone. If you’re not familiar with those 2 characters (I’ll be honest, you might not care much about the rest of this post but), The Mandalorian is an armor-clad action hero from Star Wars, who happens to also be the internet’s favorite single adoptive father, of the internet’s favorite baby, “Baby Yoda”. The Mandalorian very notably makes a point to keep his helmet on all the time. The other half of this mashup, Cubone, is one of the original 151 Pokemon. If you’ve ever read the backstory descriptions of specific Pokemon, you might know that some of these cute little guys have back stories that are just wildly dark out of nowhere. Cubone, for example, is an orphan who wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. What the fuck, this is from a game for children. Anyway. Like The Mandalorian, Cubone also very notably never takes his helmet off. So they’re two stoic helmet bros, with cool character designs, that I decided to mash up.

      <p class="pb3">Let’s get into the piece.
      </p>

      <p><b class="sans-serif">Step 1, Initial sketching:</b> I always start with a base sketch using one of the lighter, pencil-like brushes in the Procreate iPad app. Here, we’ve got Cubone in his standard, Pokemon form.
      </p>

      <p><b class="sans-serif">Step 2, Secondary sketching:</b> Next, I use more pencil, but in a different color, to add a sketch of Cubone’s Mandalorian-style armor. This is where I map out how I’ll incorporate elements of The Mandalorian’s helmet (most notably, the T-shaped visor), into Cubone’s bone helmet. The mashup is in-play!
      </p>

      <p><b class="sans-serif">Step 3, Inking:</b> Using this combined core sketch as a base, I use an Ink-style brush for the “Inking” step of the drawing, on a separate layer above the others. When that’s done, I hide the Sketching layers, and their work in our journey is complete.
      </p>

      <p><b class="sans-serif">Step 4, Painting:</b> Alright now I’ve got my PokeMandalorian ready to get some color! On a layer below the Inking layer, I color his amor, weapon, body, and cape. I could just do this step by telling the drawing software which colors should fill which spaces between the inked lines, but I find painting the colors manually kind of soothing and meditative.
      </p>

      <p><b class="sans-serif">Step 5, Shadows:</b> Now it’s time to give the drawing some depth. On a new layer above the others, I use a semi transparent black brush to add shadows, coming from an imaginary light source. Here I picture how the shadows would fall both across his body, and within the grooves of his armor.

      <p><b class="sans-serif">Step 6, Highlights:</b> The most striking aspect of The Mandalorian’s character design is his chrome armor. To create this effect, I make a couple more layers, but this time I use a couple levels of semi transparent white to add the highlights where the light is reflecting off of his armor. Creating both the general highlights and the shiny finish for the armor was one of the more challenging parts of the piece.

      <p><b class="sans-serif">Step 7, Background:</b> Our young armored Pokemon is ready to set out on some interplanetary adventures (or exact some vengeance on whoever in the Pokemon world made him an orphan). All this drawing needs now is a background. For this, I had two favorites—one deserty, one spacy.

      <p><b class="sans-serif">Step 8, Timelapse:</b> This last step is just the dessert. After finishing a drawing, I always watch the recorded time lapse video. Check that out below, and thanks for reading!
